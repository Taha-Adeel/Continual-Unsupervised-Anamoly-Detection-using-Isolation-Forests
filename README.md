# Unsupervised Shallow methods with Continual Learning
Research project under the guidance of [Dr. Bheemarjuna Reddy Tamma](https://www.iith.ac.in/cse/tbr/), in Spring 2024 at IIT Hyderabad.

## Problem Statement
- For Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), the real world data has concept drift over time, the attack data is very sparse, and labelling the training data is an expensive task.
- Furthermore, the model ideally should be light (deployable on edge devices) and have explainability.
- Hence we explore shallow unsupervised anomaly detection models without catastrophic forgetting which would be ideal for our scenario.

## Contribution
Extensive literature review and experimentation with novel tweaks to existing unsupervised literature to adapt to concept drift and improve performance.
